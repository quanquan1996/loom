description: Post to the user's bell in Loom — something they should see, decide, approve or answer, with a priority from 0 (most urgent) to 10 — and keep it right afterwards (update, re-rate, withdraw); and put things on the user's to-do list when they ask ("加到我的待办", "add to my todo"). Use when work running without the user (a virtual employee, a scheduled task, a sleep, a long job) has something for them, or the user asks for a to-do; not for replying to the user in a chat they are reading.

# loom-notify: the user's bell

The user gets many reports a day. The bell puts them in order, so the few that
need them now are seen now, and the rest wait without nagging. Your priority is
what decides when — and whether — they are interrupted. Choose it honestly.

## The command

```sh
loom-notice post --priority N [--key KEY] [--needs read|reply|approve] \
                 [--detail "background"] [--option "an answer"]... "summary"
loom-notice list                 # your notices still open
loom-notice withdraw KEY         # take one back
```

It works only in a session Loom started (it reads `LOOM_SESSION_ID`). The
notice links to your session: the user taps it and lands at the start of the
turn it came from. But most of the time they act from the bell without
opening it — so the notice itself must carry what they need (below).

A virtual employee reports through its work card's `report` instead (same
priorities, same `key`, `needs`, `detail`, `options`, and `withdraw`); the
command works too.

## Choosing the priority

| Priority | Means | What the user gets |
|---|---|---|
| **0–1** | Something is breaking or about to be lost; acting late costs real damage. | Notified at once, even at night. |
| **2** | Blocked, or a decision / permission is needed today, and it cannot wait for the evening. | Notified at once (held until 07:00 at night). |
| **3–5** | Important but can wait for the evening: a decision, a KPI ready for review, a real finding. 3 sooner, 5 later. | One notification at 20:00 for all of them. |
| **6–8** | Worth knowing: progress, a report written, a result. | No notification; seen when the user looks. Gone after a week unread. |
| **9–10** | By the way. | Same, at the bottom. |

- **Default low.** If you hesitate between two, take the less urgent. Most
  work needs no notice at all; never post "nothing happened".
- **Urgent is rare.** One urgent (0–2) a day per source gets through; a
  second the same day is posted as 3 and says so. Save it for what matters.
- **Asking permission** (deploying, deleting, pushing, sending anything out):
  `--needs approve`, priority 2 if it blocks you today, else 3–5. The user
  approves or rejects from the bell; the answer arrives in your session as a
  message (`✅ Approved: …` / `❌ Rejected: …`). Until it does, you are not
  approved.
- `--needs reply` when you need words back; `read` (the default) when it is
  only to know. A `read` notice is done once opened; `reply`/`approve` stay
  until the user answers here.

## Writing the summary

One or two plain sentences, in the user's language: **what**, and **what you
need from them**, with the deadline if there is one. No markdown, no links —
the bell shows plain text. "要部署侧栏改动（2b98e02），需要你批准；今天不批就上不了线"
beats "Deployment update".

## Enough to act on, without opening it

The user reads the bell on a phone, often hours later, without the
conversation in mind. Write each notice so it stands alone:

- `--detail`: the background in a few plain sentences — what this is about,
  what you found or did, what each choice leads to. Someone who has not read
  your session must be able to decide from it. Up to ~1000 characters.
- `--option` (repeat it): the answers you foresee, each a button that
  answers the notice in the user's words, so they need not type. **Cover the
  whole range**, not just the two you expect: the main choices, variants of
  them ("do it, but only X"), "not now / wait until …", "tell me more about …",
  "do it your way". Up to 10, short (a few words each). If there is any answer
  you can foresee, it should be a button — the user should rarely find none
  of them fits.
- For `--needs approve`, Approve / Reject are there already; options add the
  in-between answers ("approve, but deploy tonight").
- A tapped option or a typed reply reaches your session as
  `↩ <the summary>` followed by the answer, so you know what it answers.

The user may also put an urgent or important notice off until later; it
comes back to them by itself. Don't re-post it meanwhile.

## Keeping it right

- **Use a key** for anything you may update: `deploy-2b98e02`,
  `supplier-switch`. Posting the same key again replaces the open notice — new
  text, new priority — instead of adding another.
- **Re-rate** when things change: a deadline came closer, the risk grew → post
  the key again with a lower number; it notifies again only if it became more
  urgent. Say in the summary what changed.
- **Withdraw** what no longer matters (you solved it yourself, it became
  moot). Don't leave the user stale items.
- When you wake up or start a turn, `loom-notice list` and look over what you
  still have open.
- The user answering in your session settles your open notices there.

## The user's to-do list

Beside the bell is the user's own to-do list. **Add to it only when the user
asks you to** ("put it on my list", "加到待办") — never on your own; what you
think they should do is a notice, not a to-do.

```sh
loom-notice todo add "text" [--due YYYY-MM-DD]
loom-notice todos                    # the list, open first
loom-notice todo done|undo|rm ID
```

One line each, in the user's language, phrased as what they will do
("续费域名 loom.example"), with the due date if they gave one.
