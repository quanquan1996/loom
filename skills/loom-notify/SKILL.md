name: loom-notify
description: Post to the user's bell in Loom — something they should see, decide, approve or answer, with a priority from 0 (most urgent) to 10 — and keep it right afterwards (update, re-rate, withdraw); and put things on the user's to-do list when they ask ("加到我的待办", "add to my todo"). Use when work running without the user (a virtual employee, a scheduled task, a sleep, a long job) has something for them, or the user asks for a to-do; not for replying to the user in a chat they are reading.

# loom-notify: the user's bell

The user gets many reports a day. The bell puts them in order, so the few that
need them now are seen now, and the rest wait without nagging. Your priority is
what decides when — and whether — they are interrupted. Choose it honestly.

## The command

```sh
loom-notice post --priority N [--key KEY] [--needs read|reply|approve] \
                 --detail-file brief.md [--option "an answer"]... "summary"
loom-notice list                 # your notices still open
loom-notice withdraw KEY         # take one back
```

It works only in a session Loom started (it reads `LOOM_SESSION_ID`). Each
notice gets **a session of its own**, which opens on your `--detail` (the
brief). Tapping the card in the bell takes the user there, not to your
session; there they ask about it and decide, and that session's agent
passes the decision back to you. So the brief must carry what they need
(below).

A virtual employee reports through its work card's `report` instead (same
priorities, same `key`, `needs`, `detail`, `options`, and `withdraw`); the command
works too.

The bell is the only thing that reaches the user's phone: a turn ending sends
nothing. So when the user asked to be told when something is done ("好了叫我",
"跑完告诉我") and has left, post a notice (2 if they are waiting on it, else 5).

## Choosing the priority

| Priority | Means | What the user gets |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Something is breaking or about to be lost right now; waiting until 07:00 costs real damage. | Notified at once, even at night. |
| **1** | Breaking or about to be lost, but it can wait for the morning. | Notified at once. |
| **2** | Blocked, or a decision / permission is needed within hours. | Notified at once. |
| **3–5** | Important, for today: a decision, a KPI ready for review, a real finding. 3 sooner, 5 later. | Notified at once. |
| **6–8** | Worth knowing: progress, a report written, a result. | No notification; seen when the user looks. Gone after a week unread. |
| **9–10** | By the way. | Same, at the bottom. |

Every 0–5 rings the phone, one notification each, so use them only for what
the user should act on today; anything that can wait for them to look is 6+.
Between 00:00 and 07:00 only a 0 rings; the rest go out at 07:00. So a 0
wakes the user up: only for real damage that cannot wait for the morning.

- **Default low.** If you hesitate between two, take the less urgent. Most
  work needs no notice at all; never post "nothing happened".
- **Urgent is rare.** One urgent (0–2) a day per source gets through; a
  second the same day is posted as 3 and says so. Save it for what matters.
- **Asking permission** (deploying, deleting, pushing, sending anything out):
  `--needs approve`, priority 2 if it blocks you today, else 3–5. The user
  decides in the notice's own session; the answer arrives in your session as
  a message (`✅ Approved: …` / `❌ Rejected: …`). Until it does, you are not
  approved.
- `--needs reply` when you need words back; `read` (the default) when it is
  only to know. A `read` notice is done once opened; `reply`/`approve` stay
  until the user decides (in its session, or in yours) or taps Done.

## Writing the summary

One or two plain sentences, in the user's language: **what**, and **what you
need from them**, with the deadline if there is one. No markdown, no links —
the bell shows plain text; the card also shows the first two lines of the
brief, as plain words. "要部署侧栏改动（2b98e02），需要你批准；今天不批就上不了线"
beats "Deployment update".

## The brief: everything they need, in one place

The user reads it on a phone, often hours later, without your conversation
in mind, and the card alone is too little to decide on. So every notice
that asks something (`reply`, `approve`), and any `read` worth more than its
summary, gets a `--detail`: a brief in markdown that someone who never saw
your session can decide from. Write it while you have the matter in mind —
it costs you nothing now, and saves a long dig later.

- **The situation**: what this is about, and why now.
- **The specifics**: what exactly you found or changed — names, numbers,
  files, commits, links, short quotes. Not "some tests failed": which, and
  the error.
- **What you need**: the decision or answer, and the deadline if any.
- **The choices and what each leads to**, with your recommendation.
- Up to ~6000 characters; usually far less. Headings and lists are fine.
  For anything long, write it to a file and pass `--detail-file`.

- **`--option`** (repeat it, at most 5): the answers you foresee, each a few
  words as the user would say them ("批准，今天部署", "先不部署", "改成 3 点再跑").
  They are not on the card — the card is too thin to decide from — but at the
  end of the brief in the notice's session, as suggested replies the user taps
  once they have read it. Every choice you laid out in the brief gets one;
  for `approve`, give both the yes and the no. Leave them out when no answer
  can be foreseen.

The notice's session may read yours for more, around the turn the notice
came from; it passes the decision back as `↩ <the summary>` followed by the
user's words (or `✅ Approved: …` / `❌ Rejected: …`), so you know what it
answers.

The user may also put an urgent or important notice off until later; it
comes back to them by itself. Don't re-post it meanwhile.

## Keeping it right

- **Use a key** for anything you may update: `deploy-2b98e02`,
  `supplier-switch`. Posting the same key again replaces the open notice — new
  text, new priority — instead of adding another.
- **Re-rate** when things change: a deadline came closer, the risk grew → post
  the key again with a lower number; it notifies again only if it became more
  urgent. Say in the summary what changed.
- **Withdraw** what no longer matters (you solved it yourself, it became
  moot). Don't leave the user stale items.
- When you wake up or start a turn, `loom-notice list` and look over what you
  still have open.
- The user answering in your session settles your open notices there; so
  does the decision coming back from the notice's own session.

## The user's to-do list

Beside the bell is the user's own to-do list. **Add to it only when the user
asks you to** ("put it on my list", "加到待办") — never on your own; what you
think they should do is a notice, not a to-do.

```sh
loom-notice todo add "text" [--due YYYY-MM-DD]
loom-notice todos                    # the list, open first
loom-notice todo done|undo|rm ID
```

One line each, in the user's language, phrased as what they will do
("续费域名 loom.example"), with the due date if they gave one.
