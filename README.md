Loom is a single-user front end for coding agents. The agents run on your
server; Loom streams them to every device you own. Close the laptop, pick up
the phone, and the turn is still running. Nothing is sent to a model by Loom
itself: the `claude`, `codex` and `kiro-cli` CLIs do the work, with the logins
you already have (Anthropic, Bedrock, OpenAI, Kiro).

This repository is a fork of [EthanLLL/loom](https://github.com/EthanLLL/loom),
branched at `cf1facd` (2026-10-28) and developed on its own since, with 140+
commits on top. It does not track upstream.

## Highlights

- **Three agents, one UI.** Claude Code, Codex and Kiro CLI (ACP), picked per
  session, with the model picked per session too and shown on every turn.
- **Built for the phone.** A ChatGPT-style interface measured from its iOS
  app: swipeable Working cards, tap-to-answer suggested replies, one-tap copy,
  drafts that follow you between devices.
- **Turns survive restarts.** Upgrade or restart Loom mid-turn; Claude Code
  and Kiro keep working and Loom picks them up again.
- **Agents that work without you.** Scheduled tasks said in words, virtual
  employees with budgets and KPIs, a nightly Sleep that tidies memory, and a
  bell where they ask for your decision.
- **Your own machines as tools.** macOS, Linux, WSL, native Windows and
  Android join with one line (or one APK); remove a device and it uninstalls
  itself.
- **Organised, not just a list.** Projects with a shared workspace, pinning,
  incognito chats, Continue-in-new-chat, and automatic retitling and archiving.

## What's new in this fork

| Area | Upstream Loom | This fork |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent backends | Claude Code, Codex | **+ Kiro CLI** (ACP), with Claude Code's MCP servers and skills carried over |
| Model choice | Per backend | **Per session**, from the chat header; each turn labelled with the model that answered; fallback model on overload |
| Restarts | Sessions restored from disk | **Turns in flight carry on** through a restart or crash and are taken back after it |
| Interface | Dark theme | ChatGPT look, phone theme measured from ChatGPT iOS, glass header and composer, light/dark, text size per area |
| Session list | One list | Recents, **Pinned**, **Working** (last hour, swipeable cards with a recap), resizable sidebar |
| Projects | — | Sessions grouped around a **shared workspace and instructions**; a project page with Files and Sessions |
| Session kinds | Normal | **Incognito** (sandboxed, auto-deleted after 30 days), **Continue in new chat** (fork or read), classifier-stopped sessions set aside |
| Composer | Text + attachments | **Suggested replies** (incl. several questions at once), drafts synced across devices, failed messages kept with resend, atomic attachment upload |
| Copying | Select text | Tap inline code to copy; copy button under every message |
| Scheduling | `/cron` | **Tasks page**, HTTP API, wall-clock times, tasks described in plain words |
| Autonomy | — | **Virtual employees** (budget, KPIs, workstation on one device, shared boss profile), **Sleep / Dream** memory consolidation |
| Notifications | Push when a turn ends | **The bell**: prioritised notices (0–10) posted by agents, each opening a session of its own with the full brief, where you ask and decide; Later and Done; plus your to-do list. Only the bell rings the phone; 0–1 can ring through silent mode (Bark) |
| Meetings | — | **Meeting mode**: live transcript in the browser (mic + shared screen), hints every ~30 s, minutes at the end, hotwords the agent learns |
| Home | — | **loom-home**: an MQTT broker in `loom-node` and a voice server for xiaozhi-protocol robots that control home devices by speech |
| Housekeeping | — | `loom-tidy` / `loom-retitle`: retitle, archive, merge sessions, on a schedule |
| Devices (`loom-node`) | macOS, Linux, WSL | **+ native Windows, + Android** (one APK, screen control), device icons, self-uninstall on removal, install-code brute-force lock |
| Browser | Desktop window | + a **phone-shaped** window and stream |
| Deploy | `rel/deploy.sh` | **`rel/ship.sh`**: ships committed code only, never older than what is live, lists the commits and waits for `--yes` |

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for what came in which version.

## Features

### Agent sessions

- **Claude Code, Codex and Kiro**, chosen per session. Claude Code keeps one
  warm `claude -p` per session, so replies start in about 2s instead of 10s.
  Kiro runs over the Agent Client Protocol and gets Claude Code's MCP servers
  and skills.
- **Model and thinking level per session**, switched from the header; each
  turn shows which model answered. `LOOM_CLAUDE_FALLBACK_MODEL` takes over
  when the usual model is overloaded.
- **Every device sees the same session.** Start a turn on the laptop, watch it
  finish on the phone. A reconnecting tab replays only what it missed, and a
  phone back from sleep reconnects by itself.
- **Talk while it works.** A message sent mid-turn joins the running turn.
- **Turns survive restarts.** A Claude Code or Kiro turn keeps running while
  Loom is down, even after a crash, and is picked up where it was. Only a
  Codex turn is waited for before a restart.
- **Slash commands**: `/compact`, `/reload`, `/cron`, with a menu in the
  composer.

### Chat on a phone

- **Suggested replies.** An agent ends its reply with the answers it expects;
  they show as buttons that fill the composer. Several questions at once get a
  page each, and the picks come back as numbered lines.
- **Nothing gets lost.** Each session's draft is kept on the device and on the
  server, so it follows you between devices. A message that does not get
  through stays with a red "!" to resend. Attachments upload on send, all at
  once: the message goes whole or not at all.
- **One-tap copy**: tap inline code, or the copy button under any message.
- A ChatGPT look, glass header and composer, light and dark themes, text size
  per area, an unread mark, and an iOS home-screen app that keeps clear of
  iOS's top blur.

### Organising sessions

- **Projects**: sessions that share a workspace and instructions. A project
  opens a page with Files and Sessions tabs; sessions move in and out, and a
  moved session is told about its project before its next message.
- **Pinned, Working, Recents.** Sessions used in the last hour sit in Working
  until marked Done; on a phone they are cards you swipe through, each with a
  recap and the start of the last reply.
- **Incognito chats** run sandboxed (`bwrap`: read everything, write only
  their own workspace), stay out of Recents, memory and projects, and are
  deleted 30 days after their last message unless kept or pinned.
- **Continue in a new chat**: carry a long session on, by forking it or by
  having the new one read it, on the same backend or another.
- **Reference a chat**: the composer's + attaches a recent chat; the agent
  reads it only if the request needs it.
- **Share as an image**: pick the exchanges to show and get one long image
  (no tool calls), to share, save or copy.
- **Titles that keep up**: a session is retitled from its first message to
  what it is about, and to "old topic · new topic" when the talk moves on.
- **Tidy**: the `loom-tidy` and `loom-retitle` skills retitle, archive and
  merge sessions in one go, as a daily task if you like. Archived sessions
  are in Settings.
- **Handoff**: an agent that finds a matter belongs in its own conversation
  can, once you agree, open one in Recents with a brief.

### Agents that work on their own

- **Tasks.** "Every weekday at 10:00, check …": prompts on a schedule, in
  wall-clock time, created by agents from what you say, listed on a Tasks
  page, with an HTTP API (`Loom.Cron`).
- **Virtual employees.** An agent with a role, KPIs and a daily budget that
  keeps working on the projects it is given, on Claude Code, Kiro or Codex. A
  workstation can bind it to one device, enforced by a hook. Hire one from
  the form, or describe it in a chat. An employee can be held to hard
  permissions (only some tools and commands, enforced by Claude Code itself),
  for jobs that read text you can't trust, like mail. All employees
  share one boss profile, learned from your words and editable by you.
- **Sleep / Dream.** At night a hidden session goes over each project's
  sessions and consolidates Claude Code's memory, writes a report, and only
  proposes changes outside the memory directory. The memory is a git
  repository, so a night can be undone.
- **The bell.** Agents post notices with a priority from 0 to 10 and a
  brief. Each notice opens a session of its own: ask there and decide, and
  the decision goes back to the session that asked. Later puts it off, Done
  clears it. Your to-dos sit beside them.
- **Safety classifier stops** are handled: a flagged session is set aside and
  can be continued in a fresh one.

### Meetings

- **Meeting mode** from a chat's `…` menu: listens to your microphone and the
  shared screen's audio, transcribes in the browser (sherpa-onnx, Chinese and
  English, speakers told apart), and gives the chat's agent a batch about every
  30 seconds for live hints. End, ten quiet minutes or a closed page brings the
  minutes. Names it should hear right go in a hotword list the agent keeps
  itself (`loom-meeting`).

### Home (`home/`)

- **loom-home**: devices talk over the MQTT broker inside `loom-node`
  ([PROTOCOL](home/PROTOCOL.md)); a voice server lets xiaozhi-protocol robots
  control them by speech, with the device list learned at run time. See
  [home/README.md](home/README.md).

### Terminals

- Real PTY shells beside the chat, several at once, that outlive the tab and
  can be shared by two devices. OSC 52 clipboard writes reach the browser.

### Canvas and slides

- Anything an agent writes to the session's `output/` directory shows up in a
  pane beside the chat: pages, charts, dashboards, image galleries, with
  viewers for images, audio, video, Markdown, CSV and text, and a file tree of
  everything in the session.
- Pages run sandboxed on an opaque origin, so they cannot reach Loom's token
  or API.
- Ask for a deck and the agent writes a reveal.js page, with code
  highlighting, KaTeX, offline assets and a PDF button.

### Your own devices (`loom-node`)

Install `loom-node` on a Mac, a Linux box, WSL, a Windows PC or an Android
phone, and agents in any session can work on that machine as you.

- **Run commands** in your login shell (PowerShell on Windows), with output
  streamed back and the real exit code; **read and write files**,
  binary-safe.
- **Android**: one APK; with accessibility enabled, agents can see the screen
  and tap, swipe and type (`loom-node control`).
- **One-line install** from the Devices dialog: `curl … | sh`, or
  `irm … | iex` on Windows. A per-user service reconnects after sleep and
  reboot; no administrator needed.
- **Outbound only**: the device dials Loom, so it works behind NAT.
- **Safe defaults**: each device has its own token, stored only as a hash.
  Install codes last a day, and 20 wrong codes in 2 minutes void them all.
  Removing a device makes `loom-node` uninstall itself and delete its scratch
  space and logs. Everything a device runs is logged on that device.

### Browser

An optional Chromium that stays running on the host, on a virtual display
(`rel/browser/`), desktop- or phone-shaped. Agents drive it over CDP; you take
it over from **Browser** in the sidebar (noVNC, behind Loom's login) to sign
in once or pass a captcha.

### Skills that ship with Loom

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `browser` | Use the shared, logged-in Chromium |
| `slides` | reveal.js decks in the canvas |
| `loom-guide` | Answer questions about Loom from its own docs |
| `loom-notify` | Post to the bell and the to-do list |
| `loom-sessions` | Find and read an earlier session |
| `loom-handoff` | Hand a matter off to a new session |
| `loom-meeting` | Live hints, minutes and hotwords in Meeting mode |
| `loom-tidy`, `loom-retitle` | Retitle, archive and merge sessions |

### App

- Installable as a PWA. **Notifications** for the bell's important notices,
  on the lock screen too, with no account or push key of your own.
- **Vim-style keys** on desktop: `i` to type, `j`/`k` to scroll, Space as the
  leader, `?` for the list ([docs/keys.md](docs/keys.md)).

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Elixir / Erlang (see `mix.exs`), Node.js + pnpm, Go (for `loom-node`)
- At least one agent CLI on `PATH` and logged in: `claude`, `codex` or
  `kiro-cli`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/quanquan1996/loom && cd loom
mix setup && (cd frontend && pnpm install)

mix phx.server             # backend on :4000
cd frontend && pnpm dev    # frontend on :5173, proxies /api and /socket
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The password is `LOOM_PASSWORD` (`loom` in dev).

For a server, see [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md): one machine, Loom on
loopback, Cloudflare Tunnel in front, systemd. Then
release with:

```sh
rel/ship.sh            # lists the commits since what is live
rel/ship.sh --yes      # builds and restarts; running turns carry on
rel/ship.sh --frontend --yes   # frontend-only hot swap, no restart
```

## Development

| Command | |
| --- | --- |
| `mix test` | Backend tests |
| `mix precommit` | Compile with warnings as errors, format, test |
| `cd frontend && pnpm build` | Type-check and build |
| `cd frontend && pnpm md:check` | Markdown renderer cases |
| `cd frontend && pnpm transcript …` | Record / replay a live agent stream ([details](docs/architecture.md#81-debugging-record-and-replay)) |
