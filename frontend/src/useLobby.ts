/**
 * The session list, pushed over the `agents` channel instead of polled.
 *
 * The join reply is the whole list, and phoenix.js fires the join's "ok" again
 * on every rejoin — so a reconnect replaces the list wholesale and nothing
 * missed while offline needs replaying. Between joins, each session pushes its
 * summary whenever its header changes.
 *
 * A summary can arrive older than the copy we hold (the server subscribes
 * before it reads the list), so the higher `seq` wins.
 *
 * `watching` goes the other way: which session this device is showing, for a
 * device with notifications on, so the server holds back the ones for what is
 * already on screen. Sent on every join too, as the server forgets it with the
 * channel.
