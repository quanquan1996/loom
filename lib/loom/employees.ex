defmodule Loom.Employees do
  @moduledoc """
  Virtual employees: an agent that keeps working while Loom is up, on projects
  it is given, toward KPIs the user sets, and says when it needs them.

  - **Two sessions each**, hidden from the lists and opened from the
    employee's page: `employee_chat`, where the user talks to it, and
    `employee_work`, where it works. Every turn of the work session is either
    a wake-up from here or the user answering a report, so the work session
    *is* the report: what it did, and what it asked. Both start in the
    employee's own workspace, so they share Claude Code's memory and files.
  - **A heartbeat, not a loop.** A tick every minute wakes an employee whose
    time has come: the hour it asked for, its heartbeat, the user's "wake
    now", the daily or weekly report. Each wake-up is one turn, which ends with
    a work card (`Loom.Employees.Card`): when to wake next, KPI progress, and
    whether there is something to report. No card is a sleep until the next
    heartbeat.
  - **Within its hours** (all day unless set), except for the reports.
  - **A budget per day**, in the user's wall-clock day. Every turn of either
    session counts (`{:turn_cost, id, usd}` from the sessions). Spent, the
    work stops — a turn running is interrupted — and the user is asked once;
    what they approve on top counts for that day only.
  - **Permissions are soft.** The projects it is given are named in its
    instructions with their workspaces, and it is told to stay in them; it
    runs as the same user as every other agent, so nothing enforces it.
  - **Reports** go three ways: `info` is only written down, `important` is a
    notification, `urgent` a notification and the employee marked as blocked
    until a later turn says otherwise. Daily and weekly reports are files it
    writes under `reports/`, listed on its page.
  - **The boss profile**, one for all of them: facts and rules about the user
    that hold whatever the job ("reply in Chinese", "no finance work on
    AWS"), a sentence each with who heard it and when. An employee adds one
    through its card's `boss` and it applies at once, to every employee, with
    no one asked; the user adds, edits and deletes them in Settings. Every
    wake-up and `.employee/status.md` carry it whole; a chat is told what
    changed ahead of its next message. Rules for one employee's job stay with
    that employee. Mirrored to `~/.loom/boss.md` for Sleep, which leaves its
    facts there rather than storing them again.

  Truth is `~/.loom/employees.json`. What the agents should be able to read
  without asking — profile, KPIs, status — is mirrored into `.employee/` in
  the workspace on every change.
