defmodule Loom.Dream.Prompt do
  @moduledoc """
  What a sleep session is told each night. Built on Claude Code's own dream
  prompt (2.1.312: orient, gather, consolidate, prune) and on what sleep does
  for memory in the brain:

  - **Replay, not search.** The hippocampus replays the day's episodes in
    sleep; Claude Code's prompt only greps for what it already suspects. So
    every session since the last night is gone over, its user messages in
    full, and from how it ended back to what led there.
  - **Not everything is kept.** The brain consolidates what was tagged as
    mattering: corrections, things to remember, costly mistakes, what came up
    again and again.
  - **Gist, with a way back.** Consolidation turns episodes into general
    knowledge; each memory keeps a pointer to where it came from, and how sure
    it is, since sleep consolidation also produces false memories.
  - **Forgetting is part of it.** Sleep weakens what was not used. Memories
    that no longer earn their place are archived, not deleted.
  - **REM: far associations.** Patterns across sessions and projects, problems
    left unsolved, a procedure done by hand often enough to become a skill —
    proposed, never acted on alone.

  The prompt for one night. `ctx` has `:memory_dir`, `:scope_name`,
  `:sessions` (see `Loom.Dream`), `:last_run_at` (ms or nil), `:utc_offset`
  and `:others` (`[{name, memory_dir}]`, read-only).
  """
  def build(ctx) do
    """
    You are performing a sleep for #{ctx.scope_name} — a pass over its memory, the way sleep consolidates memory in the brain. Loom started this turn, not the user; the user reads your reply in the morning, as a report, and may answer it in this same conversation.

    Memory directory: `#{ctx.memory_dir}`
    Its index: `#{Path.join(ctx.memory_dir, "MEMORY.md")}`
    Now: #{local(System.system_time(:millisecond), ctx.utc_offset)}. Last sleep: #{if ctx.last_run_at, do: local(ctx.last_run_at, ctx.utc_offset), else: "never"}.

    The memory format, types and what not to save are in your system prompt's auto-memory section; follow it.

    ## Ground rules

    - Write only inside the memory directory. Read anything you need, but do not change code, CLAUDE.md, settings or skills tonight: anything outside the memory directory is a proposal (Phase 5).
    - Never invent. Every memory you add or change must trace back to something the user said or something that happened in a session. If you are generalising, say so.
    - Don't delete what fell out of use: move it to `archive/` inside the memory directory and drop it from the index. Delete only what is now known to be wrong.
    - Use absolute dates (YYYY-MM-DD), never "yesterday".

    ## Phase 1 — Orient

    `ls` the memory directory, read the index, and skim every memory file, so you improve what is there instead of writing near-duplicates.

    ## Phase 2 — Replay

    #{sessions_text(ctx.sessions)}

    Claude Code transcripts are JSONL. Don't read them whole. For each one:

    - All of the user's messages (they are short, and they are where corrections and preferences are):
      `jq -r 'select(.type=="user" and (.message.content|type)=="string") | .message.content' FILE | cut -c1-600`
    - How it ended, then work back from there to what led to it:
      `jq -r 'select(.type=="assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type=="text") | .text' FILE | tail -c 4000`
    - Anything else only with narrow `grep`s, for things you already suspect matter.

    ## Phase 3 — Weigh

    Not everything is worth keeping. In rough order of weight:

    1. The user corrected the agent, or said how they want things done (feedback).
    2. The user said to remember something.
    3. A mistake that cost time, and what fixed it.
    4. What came up in more than one session.
    5. Decisions and their reasons; facts about the project that the code does not show.

    Skip what is only of use to that one conversation, and what the repository already records.

    ## Phase 4 — Consolidate and prune

    - Merge into the existing topic files; one fact, one place.
    - Each memory you add or change gets a source line: `Source: <session title> (<session id>), YYYY-MM-DD`. Something you inferred rather than were told is marked as inferred.
    - A memory contradicted by what you saw tonight: fix it at the source.
    - A memory that no longer earns its place — stale, superseded, or never used and of little value — goes to `archive/`.
    - Keep `MEMORY.md` an index: one line per memory, under ~150 characters, `- [Title](file.md) — hook`, nothing archived in it.

    ## Phase 5 — Dream

    Step back from single facts. Look for what only shows across sessions:

    - A preference or correction that recurs: one general memory, not several particular ones.
    - A procedure the user had done by hand more than once: propose a skill for it (name, and what it would do).
    - A problem left unsolved: one short, concrete idea for a fresh look, if you have one.
    #{others_text(ctx.others)}

    Act on none of these yourself. They go in the report, under "Needs your OK", along with any deletion of something the user explicitly asked to remember.

    ## The report

    Your reply is the morning report. Write it in the language the user writes in, in the sessions above. Short, and in this shape, leaving out empty sections:

    **One line**: how many sessions you went over, and the gist of the night.

    ### Remembered
    New memories: file — one line — which session.
    ### Updated
    What was merged, corrected or rewritten.
    ### Archived
    What went to `archive/`, and why.
    ### Noticed
    Patterns, and ideas for open problems.
    ### Needs your OK
    A numbered list of proposals, each one line with what you would do. End with: reply with the numbers to go ahead (e.g. "1 yes, 2 no").

    If nothing needed changing, say so in one line.

    When the user answers later in this conversation, do what they agreed to — that is when a skill is written (under `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) or anything outside the memory directory is changed.
