defmodule Loom.Agent.Carry do
  @moduledoc """
  "Continue in a new chat": the user carries a session on in a new one,
  because it ended in an error (a safety classifier's stop among them), grew
  long, or they want a branch of it. One tap; Loom picks how.

    * `:fork` — a Claude Code session that ended well and is not long: the new
      one starts on a copy of its conversation (`--fork-session`), so nothing
      is lost. The old one is left as it was.
    * `:read` — anything else: the new one starts empty and reads the old one
      with `loom-session read --files`. An error or a classifier's stop is not
      carried over, nor is a context near its limit.

  It may move to another backend (the header's arrow beside "Continue in new
  chat"): then it is always `:read`, as no engine can resume another's store.

  Either way its first turn is a handoff summary of at most five lines, then
  it waits for the user. The new session is on the user's own model, not the
  old one's: a fallback the old one fell to is not inherited.
