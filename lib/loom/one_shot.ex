defmodule Loom.OneShot do
  @moduledoc """
  The model calls Loom makes of its own, rather than through a session: a
  one-shot `claude -p` on the smallest model, with no tools, no MCP servers, no
  settings or memory and nothing persisted. About two seconds and a fifth of a
  cent (measured).

  Used to file a new session into a project (`Loom.Projects.Classifier`) and
  to read a task the user described in words (`Loom.Cron.Describe`).

  No settings, but their `env`: on a host logged in through Bedrock that is
  where the login is (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `AWS_REGION` in
  `~/.claude/settings.json`), and the service's own environment has none of
  it. Without them every call answered "Not logged in" and each new session
  was quietly left out of its project.
